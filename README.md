# HTTP Scan
---
This is the python code for my practice purpose. This can scan the http port: 80 and see which application listening on in interested subnet. The result will be generated in the same folder with filename: *result\_subnet.txt*

Usage:
```
$python http_scan.py
Please input the IP subnet: 192.168.1.0
Please input the subnetmask: 24
The result fo scanning port 80 for 192.168.1.0/24:
192.168.1.0 : N/A
```
